    <p class="mb-0">"Robin has been a great asset to my software team. His deep Python and
    GIS skills have been very effective in developing new capabilities,
    underpinned by a willingness to research new solutions to complex
    requirements. He has been an ideal team-member, for whom distributed
    working in these unusual COVID-19 times has come quite naturally. Whilst
    only committed part-time to my project, this self-motivated worker has
    been very productive, maintaining an impressive throughput."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"It is a pleasure working with Robin. He has taken some rough ideas of mine and quickly turned them
        into an interactive,
        online air quality map for Southampton, as well as producing static visualisations of complex data sets. Robin
        responds promptly to queries, offers different approaches to problem solving and makes the requested changes quickly. He also has
        a wealth of knowledge around GIS, programming and air pollution which has been invaluable for this project."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"I can remark that Robin has contributed a huge amount to RSPSoc and has been, and I am sure will continue to
        be, a
        huge asset to our community. I would have no hesitation in recommending Robin in the strongest possible terms
        for his
        commitment, attention to detail, high academic standards, unstinting enthusiasm and determined work ethic."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"The students thoroughly enjoyed your talk, but more importantly were challenged by it. Having a greater understanding of
    the concepts you covered, and the implications to the various academic disciplines they study, is a real privilege for
    them, as well as an insight into the conceptual demands of tertiary education. Any one of those concepts could be used
    to reconsider - be it for 24 hours, or 24 years - what they know and how they see the world around them."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"The talk that Robin gave to our group was excellent.
        The clever animated video clips, accompanied by a clear vocal description gave an easily-understood picture of
        the
        underlying principles involved. The wide range of topics taken from situations familiar to everyone made the
        examples
        pertinent to all present and maintained their interest throughout. A thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking
        talk."</p>

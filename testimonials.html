    <p class="mb-0">"It is a pleasure working with Robin. He has taken some rough ideas of mine and quickly turned them
        into an interactive,
        online air quality map for Southampton, as well as producing static visualisations of complex data sets. Robin
        responds promptly to queries, offers different approaches to problem solving and makes the requested changes quickly. He also has
        a wealth of knowledge around GIS, programming and air pollution which has been invaluable for this project."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"I can remark that Robin has contributed a huge amount to RSPSoc and has been, and I am sure will continue to
        be, a
        huge asset to our community. I would have no hesitation in recommending Robin in the strongest possible terms
        for his
        commitment, attention to detail, high academic standards, unstinting enthusiasm and determined work ethic."</p>

    <p class="mb-0">"The talk that Robin gave to our group was excellent.
        The clever animated video clips, accompanied by a clear vocal description gave an easily-understood picture of
        the
        underlying principles involved. The wide range of topics taken from situations familiar to everyone made the
        examples
        pertinent to all present and maintained their interest throughout. A thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking
        talk."</p>

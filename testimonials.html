<p class="testimonial">"It is a pleasure working with Robin. He has taken some rough ideas of mine and quickly turned them into an interactive,
    online air quality map for Southampton, as well as producing static visualisations of complex data sets. Robin responds promptly
    to queries, offers different approaches to problem solving and makes the requested changes quickly. He also has a
    wealth of knowledge around GIS, programming and air pollution which has been invaluable for this project."</p>
